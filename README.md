Information in this file relates to the social security calculator
project with John Iselin, Rob McClelland, and Philip Stallworth. It
will inititally be written and python, but may need to be replaced
conditional on the development of the remainder of the project. I will
proceed by building an increasingly robust calculator. I will begin
with the most basic social security calculator and then move forward.

The first step will be to figure out how the calculator works and
sketch out the basic process. 

In first phase I will assume noone works and receives social
security. I will also build it for a primary earner. The following
link provides the broad outlines in steps 1-6 for the full retirement
benefit calculation. Pretty straightforward. I will need to build a
csv file with year, maximum earnings, and index factors [done].
